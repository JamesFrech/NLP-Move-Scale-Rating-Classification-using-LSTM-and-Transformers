of last year's best action movie , speed , we have twister about teams of risk taking meteorologists chasing tornadoes . surprisingly , twister is one boring movie peppered with some nifty effects . it was so bad that had it not been for wanting to see all the special effects , i would have been ready to walk out . since the characters are not believable , you do not care if they come into harm's way , and hence the special effects , although technically impressive , are never frightening . as melissa ( jami gertz ) says in the show about another subject , \\\" funny thing is . i'm not that upset . \\\" i felt that way about the tornadoes in the film . twister is actually three movies for the cost of one . finally , there are the special tornado effects demonstrations by industrial light and magic . the film makes you think that a lot of people living in the tornado belt have tornado shelters . this is just not true . i saw one in my entire life , and that was at someone's house who was afraid the commies were going to drop the big one on him . also not considered in the film are the issue of warnings . so what . what were we going to do ? also , if you are warned all of the time , you soon learn to either ignore it or just worry a lot . all of this notwithstanding , i was able to suspend disbelief , but the film is so bad it didn't help . they drive a bunch of beat-up vehicles that look like they will fall apart at any moment . the original script by michael crichton is ridiculous . he should stick to books . beside the trite lines , the movie telegraphs every punch for some reason . aren't they supposed to be trying to scare us ? consider just one example . for some reason the tornado chasers decide to stop at a drive-in movie to get a cup of coffee while the drive-in is playing the horror classic the shining . what do you think will happen ? the setup is so contrived . look , the special effects are just that , special in this movie . they are technically brilliant , but without a good script and characters that come alive , after a while i found the effects repetitious and boring . technically brilliant certainly , but stuck in a lifeless movie . other than the technically impressive special effects , i liked seeing hunt and paxton . hunt is so smart , tough , and sensual all at once . paxton is a great minor actor i have enjoyed for a long time . as much as i was glad to see them again , i never found their characters in the movie believable . the show is funny in parts as when a large cow keeps flying by them as in the wizard of oz . finally , kudos for the nice computer graphics . realistic without being overdone . twister runs 1 : 45 . it is rated pg-13 . there is no sex , no nudity , almost no bad language and no violence other than the natural violence caused by tornadoes . the shots of the tornadoes trivializes the human suffering and dwells mostly with flying objects and property damage . the film would be fine for any kid over say 8 . there is no show ; there are only special effects , and these are not enough for me to recommend this disappointing film . to be fair , i should point out that my wife liked the film . the large audience where i saw it was pretty subdued , so i do not know how much most people will like it . i give the film * 1/2 , but only for the special effects . * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year . a must see film . * * * = excellent show . look for it . * * = average movie . kind of enjoyable . * = poor show . don't waste your money . 0 = one of the worst films of this or any year . totally unbearable . review written on : may 10 , 1996 opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .\",\n          \"screenplay : james cameron . director : james cameron . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , violence , profanity ) running time : 195 minutes . titanic , the perfectionist auteur's baby which missed its summer release date . titanic , the entertainment industry headline . not titanic , the movie . . . titanic , the _story_ . it's hard for a film to crawl out from under that kind of baggage , so give james cameron all the credit in the world : for nearly half the film's running time , i forgot that i was watching _that_ titanic . only the jealous cal -- and an inconvenient iceberg -- can stand in the way of their love . dicaprio and winslet share an extraordinary chemistry , two charismatic young actors with mischievous eyes who create a tangibly passionate pairing . though most of the characters around them are more functional than fleshed-out , particularly billy zane's sneering patrician , the two stars likely would have overwhelmed all comers regardless of their multi-dimensionality . this may be the year's most effective and consistently entertaining love story . oh , and it's also about a big boat going belly-up . those who come for the sinking rather than the swooning aren't likely to be disappointed with the spectacle cameron offers . his obsession with historical accuracy begins with the dazzling duplication of the ship's lavish decor and ends with a virtually real-time re-creation of its journey to the bottom of the atlantic . titanic is an impressively-mounted disaster movie during its second half , but it's still basically a disaster movie . once the ship is down , and the lovers once again have time to share a powerful , quiet moment , it becomes clear that the large-scale drama can't match the small-scale drama . people will want to go see titanic simply to see what a $200 million movie looks like . and it looks great , rich in period detail and sweeping views of cameron's massive scale-model titanic . more important than how it looks , though , is how it feels . it feels like it has a heart , real emotion powering the narrative in a way dollar signs can't . somewhere past the headlines , the gossip , the turmoil and the accounting details is a magnificent piece of epic film-making . it's time for titanic , the movie , to sink or swim on its own impressive merits . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line \\\" subscribe
